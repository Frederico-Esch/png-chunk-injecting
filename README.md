# Hiding data inside png
## Purpose
This is basically my playground on injecting data inside pngs, still not really usable, unless you want to base your own code on mine then I guess it works fine. 

I plan to make it more usable, documented and expandable in the future, almost as a library, but this is definitely not one of my main projects.

## How it works (as for now)
- origin.c

This copies one image of reference and injects the chunk on the copy.
after compiling it, just give the executable the image of choice as one argument, and it will inject something (my plan is for the data to be hiden to also be passed as an argument to the executable).

- reconstruct.c

It's purpose is to take the data out of the file generated by origin.c, right now it searches for the chunk called `ffFf` for it's what I used as a placeholder when creating origin.c, but never changed.

Watched a bit of one of his videos on hiding data inside a png, got the link of the png documentation and made tried for myself, really satisfied with how it turned out.
